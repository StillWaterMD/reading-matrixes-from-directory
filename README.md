# reading-matrixes-from-directory
Training C# program.
This program will read files from directory. files should have following structure:
-----------
name of operation

1 2
3 4

5 6
7 8
---------
 operation name could be one on these "multiply, add, subtract, transpose"
 
there are no checks for incorrect matrixes yet, so make sure that it's possible to multiply/add/transpose matrixes in files (size   wise or content wise). it's possible that i'll add these checks in future like this in future.

for operation multiply, add, subtract there should be only 2 matrixes in file.
for operation transpose - at least one matrix in file (can be 2,3,4 and more)
